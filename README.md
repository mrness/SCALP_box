### SCALP test ###

Initial Issues
During the setup process, I encountered the following issues:

Install errors: I ran into some errors while trying to install the required software and packages. These errors were related to missing dependencies and conflicts with existing packages.

SSL issue: I encountered an SSL issue when trying to install the packages from a remote repository. The SSL certificate for the repository was not recognized by my system, causing the installation to fail.

#Solution
To overcome these issues, I took the following steps:

Resolved install errors: I resolved the install errors by installing the missing dependencies and resolving the package conflicts.

Renamed the .box file: To resolve the SSL issue, I renamed the .box file to have the .box extension, and installed the box from the local .box file.

#Conclusion
By overcoming these initial issues, I was able to successfully set up the environment and get started with the project.

Note: This README.md file serves as a record of the initial issues and their solutions, so that others can learn from my experience and avoid similar issues in the future.
